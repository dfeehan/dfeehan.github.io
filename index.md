I'm a demographer and quantitative social scientist. <br>
<br>
My research interests lie at the intersection of networks, demography, and
quantitative methodology.
I'm an Assistant Professor of Demography at the
<a href="https://www.demog.berkeley.edu">University of California, Berkeley</a>.
In the summer of 2015, I finished my Ph.D. at Princeton's
<a href="https://opr.princeton.edu">Office of Population Research</a>, and
I spent the fall of 2015 as a Research Scientist at 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/data">Facebook</a>.

**Updates**

I co-organized the [IUSSP Expert Group Meeting on Population Data for the 21st Century](https://iussp.org/en/egm-population-data-21st-century) at UNFPA in New York. Slides and videos of the talks will be posted on the website soon.  
  
I very much enjoyed giving a talk at a panel presentation for UCLA's Summer Institute in Computational Social Science.  
  
I had a great visit to the University of Michigan, where I gave a talk for the Population Studies Center Brown Bag.
  
I had a wonderful visit to Ohio State, where I gave a talk at the PRI Seminar.
  
I'm thrilled to have been awarded the ASA Outstanding Article in Mathematical Sociology Award! Check out the paper, written with Matt Salganik, [here](https://goo.gl/Xcxino)  (arxiv version [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4009)). Congrats to co-winners Joscha Legewie and Merlin Schaeffer for their work on contested boundaries.

I gave a keynote talk and tutorial at the pre-PAA workshop, 'Demographic Research in the Digital Age' (sponsored by IUSSP). I also gave two talks during the PAA conference. 

I had a great visit to Duke, where I gave a talk at the DuPRI Seminar.

I gave a talk at the Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences at the University of
Washington, a wonderful group of researchers.

In June, I was invited to the US State Department, where I gave a talk hosted by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research.

I had a great visit to UW Madison, where I gave a talk in their [demography seminar](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/cde/demsem/home.php) on March 14th.

I was interviewed about our work on social network methods for estimating adult mortality 
by the [Matrix](https://matrix.berkeley.edu/research/network-survival-method).


Emilio Zagheni and I co-organized a workshop on 
[Web, Social Media, and Cellphone Data for Demographic Research](http://projects.demog.berkeley.edu/socinfo2016/) at [SocInfo 2016](https://usa2016.socinfo.eu/).

I very much enjoyed visiting and giving a talk at the Stanford [RAIN seminar series](https://rain.stanford.edu/) on November 2nd.
