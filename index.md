I'm a demographer and quantitative social scientist. <br>
<br>
My research interests lie at the intersection of networks, demography, and
quantitative methodology.
I'm an Assistant Professor of Demography at the
<a href="http://www.demog.berkeley.edu">University of California, Berkeley</a>.
In the summer of 2015, I finished my Ph.D. at Princeton's
<a href="http://opr.princeton.edu">Office of Population Research</a>, and
I spent the fall of 2015 as a Research Scientist at 
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/data">Facebook</a>.

I had a great visit to UW Madison, where I gave a talk in their [demography seminar](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/cde/demsem/home.php) on March 14th.

I was interviewed about our work on social network methods for estimating adult mortality 
by the [Matrix](http://matrix.berkeley.edu/research/network-survival-method).


Emilio Zagheni and I co-organized a workshop on 
[Web, Social Media, and Cellphone Data for Demographic Research](http://projects.demog.berkeley.edu/socinfo2016/) at [SocInfo 2016](http://usa2016.socinfo.eu/).

I very much enjoyed visiting and giving a talk at the Stanford [RAIN seminar series](http://rain.stanford.edu/) on November 2nd.
