I'm a demographer and quantitative social scientist.    
    
My [research interests](research.html) lie at the intersection of networks, demography, and
quantitative methodology.   
     
I'm currently an Associate Professor of Demography at the
[University of California, Berkeley](https://www.demog.berkeley.edu).

In the summer of 2015, I finished my Ph.D. at Princeton's
[Office of Population Research](https://opr.princeton.edu), and
I spent the fall of 2015 as a Research Scientist at 
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/data).

I'm thrilled to have been awarded the ASA Outstanding Article in Mathematical Sociology Award! Check out the paper, written with Matt Salganik, [here](https://goo.gl/Xcxino)  (arxiv version [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4009)). Congrats to co-winners Joscha Legewie and Merlin Schaeffer for their work on contested boundaries.

I gave a keynote talk and tutorial at the pre-PAA workshop, 'Demographic Research in the Digital Age' (sponsored by IUSSP). I also gave two talks during the PAA conference. 

I had a great visit to Duke, where I gave a talk at the DuPRI Seminar.

I gave a talk at the Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences at the University of
Washington, a wonderful group of researchers.
