I'm a demographer and quantitative social scientist.    
    
My [research interests](research.html) lie at the intersection of networks, demography, and
quantitative methodology.   
     
I'm currently an Associate Professor of Demography at the
[University of California, Berkeley](https://www.demog.berkeley.edu)
and Faculty Director of the [D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/home).
