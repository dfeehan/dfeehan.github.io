    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nThis course provides a broad introduction to the empirical and theoretical study of social networks. We will cover classic and contemporary studies, beginning with fundamental definitions and models, and then moving through a range of topics, including models of network formation and structure (homophily, foci, communities); dynamic processes on networks (contagion, influence, and disease models); collaborative networks; personal networks; online networks; and network sampling and data collection. The course material is intended to be of interest to students from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds, including demography, sociology, statistics, computer science, and related fields.\nThis syllabus is not yet final - I’m posting it to give you a sense for what we will cover this semester.

    "section": "Requirements and assignments",
    "text": "Requirements and assignments\nThe requirements of the class are designed to achieve two goals: the first goal is to become familiar with some classic and contemporary research about social networks through reading papers and discussing them; and the second goal is to write a research paper. You should think of the research paper as the first draft of a project that you might be able to continue working on beyond this class.\n\nReading and class participation\nEach week, you should read the assigned materials and show up to class prepared to discuss them. One of the weeks you will also be in charge of organizing the discussion. (Depending on enrollment, you may be in charge of part of the readings in an additional week.) To lead the discussion, I suggest that you make a short slide deck summarizing each of the readings (similar to the papers to present, below), and you think of a few questions to prompt discussions for each reading.\nResponse memos\nFor 5 of the class meetings, please write a short response memo (1 to 2 pages) and post it on the Ed thread for that week. (There is an Ed tag for each week of the semester). You can pick which of the weeks you write the memos, starting with week 3. These memos should not take an enormous amount of time to write. The main goal of these memos is to help you focus your thoughts about the reading prior to our group discussion; to help us get an understanding of what parts of the reading our discussion should focus on; and to serve as a reference for you in the future. The format of the memos is open, but at a minimum I would like you to be sure to (1) quickly summarize how the readings relate to one another (if you think they do); and (2) briefly describe at least one research idea that the readings generated for you (this could be a single sentence, or the entire memo; it’s up to you). The response memos are due by noon on the day before each class.\nPapers to present\nEach week, there will be a list of readings that we will not have time to discuss as a group. For 4 of the class meetings, please choose one of these papers, read it, and briefly present it to the class. You should ‘claim’ the paper you want to present by posting to a Ed thread for the given week, to ensure that two people don’t end up preparing a presentation for the same paper. (Also, if you have a paper that is on-topic, but not on the syllabus, you can ask me to present that one instead. I will typically say yes, as long as it is relevant to the discussion that week.) These presentations should be around 5-8 minutes each. Please plan to make slides or find some other way to help the class understand the paper’s main findings. The goals of these presentations are (1) to give you some practice taking a deep dive into a networks research paper; (2) to give you some practice distilling technical results for a broader audience; (3) to give you and the class some exposure to cutting edge ideas in social networks; (4) to give you an opportunity to spend time on papers that are particularly useful for your research.\nFinal paper\nYou will write a short (10-20 pages) research paper or proposal for a research project to conclude the class. Leading up to the end of the class, you will submit a brief proposal (1 paragraph to 1 page) that describes the paper you plan to work on. I will also ask you to briefly pitch your idea to get some fast feedback early on. The purpose of the proposal is to give you some feedback on the initial idea / data source / etc before you invest a lot of time writing an actual paper. Your final paper should identify an important problem to be studied, briefly review the related literature, describe your proposed research design, and present some (possibly preliminary) empirical findings.\nThe purpose of this paper is to connect the topics of this class to your actual research, so my hope is that this will be an opportunity to get some feedback on an idea you care about, and that you might continue to pursue beyond class. We will have a mini-conference with short presentations for each project at the end of the semester.\nThe final paper is due at 5pm on Monday, December 11th.\n\nNB: Please read each week’s articles in the order they are listed on the syllabus"

The regular campus appeals process applies if a mutually satisfactory arrangement cannot be achieved.\nStatement on Academic Freedom\nBoth students and instructors have rights to academic freedom. Please respect the rights of others to express their points of view in the classroom.\nDSP Accommodations\nPlease see the instructor to discuss accommodations for physical disabilities, medical disabilities and learning disabilities.\nStudent Resources\nThe Student Learning Center provides a wide range of resources to promote learning and academic success for students. For information regarding these services, please consult the Student Learning Center Website: https://slc.berkeley.edu/\nAcademic Integrity\nThe high academic standard at the University of California, Berkeley, is reflected in each degree that is awarded. As a result, every student is expected to maintain this high standard by ensuring that all academic work reflects unique ideas or properly attributes the ideas to the original sources.\nThese are some basic expectations of students with regards to academic integrity:\n\nAny work submitted should be your own individual thoughts, and should not have been submitted for credit in another course unless you have prior written permission to re-use it in this course from this instructor.\nAll assignments must use “proper attribution,” meaning that you have identified the original source and extent or words or ideas that you reproduce or use in your assignment. This includes drafts and homework assignments!\nIf you are unclear about expectations, ask your instructor or GSI.\nDo not collaborate or work with other students on assignments or projects unless you have been given permission or instruction to do so."
