    "text": "Overview\nThe science of social networks focuses on measuring, modeling, and understanding the different ways that people are connected to one another. In this class, we will use a broad toolkit of theories and methods drawn from the social, natural, and mathematical sciences to learn what a social network is, to understand how to work with social network data, and to illustrate some of the ways that social networks can be useful in theory and in practice. We will see that network ideas are powerful enough to be used everywhere from CDC and UNAIDS, where network models help epidemiologists prevent the spread of HIV, to Silicon Valley, where data scientists use network ideas to build products that enable people all across the globe to connect with one another.\nPlease re-check the syllabus frequently; it will be updated as the semester progresses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheme\nWeek\nDate\nTopic\nDemo\nLab\nHwk\n\n\n\n\nIntro + Personal Networks\n1\nThu, Aug 28\nIntro / what social networks are / basic graph theory / class info\nGiant component\nLab 0: Getting started w/ Jupyter notebook / test submitting a lab\nMini Project 01: Personal network data\n\n\n\n\n2\nTue, Sep 2\nPersonal networks; social connectedness and social isolation in America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork structure: foundations\n2\nThu, Sep 4\nTriadic closure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nTue, Sep 9\nStrength of Weak Ties, Social Capital, Structural Holes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nThu, Sep 11\nNetwork centrality / the Friendship Paradox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nTue, Sep 16\nNetworks in context; homophily; affiliation networks; and foci\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nThu, Sep 18\nPositive and negative networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nTue, Sep 23\nIntro to mathematical network models; the Erdos-Renyi model and its predictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall worlds\n5\nThu, Sep 25\nSmall worlds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nTue, Sep 30\nSearch in small worlds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nThu, Oct 2\nScale-free networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork structure: advanced\n7\nTue, Oct 7\nEmpirical studies of network structure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nThu, Oct 9\nMidterm review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nTue, Oct 14\nMidterm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nThu, Oct 16\nMore models: configuration model and stochastic block model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\nTue, Oct 21\nCommunity detection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamics: Simple contagion\n9\nThu, Oct 23\nDiseases and simple contagion in general; SIR model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\nTue, Oct 28\nSIR model on networks; centrality, influence and network disease models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcurrency\n10\nThu, Oct 30\nSexual networks, concurrency, and HIV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\nTue, Nov 4\nEmpirical studies of simple contagion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial influence\n11\nThu, Nov 6\nSocial influence, herding, and cascades\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nTue, Nov 11\nThreshold models and complex contagion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamics: Complex contagion and social influence\n12\nThu, Nov 13\nComplex contagion on networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\nTue, Nov 18\nComplex contagion on networks, cont. + Empirical studies of complex contagion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\nThu, Nov 20\nTBA - possible guest lecture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\nTue, Nov 25\nNO CLASS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\nThu, Nov 27\nTHANKSGIVING (NO CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCooperation\n15\nTue, Dec 2\nCooperation and networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\nThu, Dec 4\nWrap up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\nTue, Dec 9\nREADING WEEK"

    "text": "Requirements\n\nGrades\nYour grade will be calculated as a weighted average of several different class requirements, which are explained in greater detail below.\n\n\n\nComponent\n% of grade\n\n\n\n\nLabs (~8; you can drop your lowest score)\n15\n\n\nMini-projects (~4 of these)\n25\n\n\nProblem sets (3 of these)\n10\n\n\nMid-term exam\n15\n\n\nFinal exam\n30\n\n\nParticipation + Quizzes\n5\n\n\n\n\n\nLectures\nLectures will introduce and develop key theoretical and technical concepts in the study of social networks. To illustrate these ideas, some of the lectures will have a live lab / demo component, where we will interactively discuss and work through an analysis in a Jupyter notebook. These live labs will help us explore and develop intuition about key concepts in the course.\nYou are responsible for all of the material covered in lectures, as well as any announcements made there.\n\n\nRequired readings\nThe course readings will include selections from the textbook Networks, Crowds, and Markets by Easley and Kleinberg:\n\nDavid Easley and Jon Kleinberg Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World (Cambridge University Press, 2010).\n\nWe will also read chapters from popular science books written by leading network researchers, including selections from\n\nD. J. Watts Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age (WW Norton & Company, 2003).\nHelen Epstein The Invisible Cure: Why We Are Losing the Fight Against AIDS in Africa (Macmillan, 2008).\n\nThere will also be selected other readings where they are relevant to our discussions.\nThe readings serve two purposes: (1) they provide an introduction and reference for key concepts that we will need to study social networks; (2) they illustrate how social network ideas get used in real world research and applications across many different disciplines. You are expected to do the reading before each class. Whenever possible, PDFs of the readings will be posted on the bCourses site.\n\n\nHomeworks and labs\nThere will be a total of 6 to 8 homeworks, a similar number of labs, and one mini-project. These assignments are a critical part of the learning you will do in this class: they give you an opportunity to explore the topics we cover in the readings and in lecture on your own. They also give you a chance to practice your writing and your data analysis and programming skills. Most homeworks and labs will ask you to provide some written arguments and to solve some problems by writing Python code in a Jupyter notebook.\nLabs are graded based on effort; therefore, you can get full credit on a lab even if you do not get all of the answers right. Labs must be handed in on time for full credit.\nHomeworks and are graded on correctness and must be handed in on time for full credit. However, we will drop the homework with the lowest score; thus, you can miss handing in one homework over the course of the semester without it affecting your grade. (Note that you cannot drop the grade for the mini-project.)\nThe mini-project is like an extended homework that comes after all of the notebook-based homeworks. The goal is to give you a chance to start from scratch with a new network dataset and to demonstrate that you can perform an analysis on the network with minimal hand-holding. It will count as two homeworks.\nCollaboration: It can be helpful and educational to discuss the assignments with other students in the class, but (1) all of the work should be your own (i.e., you are not allowed to just copy code, answers, or arguments); (2) you should make a note of the names of the other students you worked with when handing your assignments in. Please treat AI tools like ChatGPT like another student: follow rules (1) and (2); that is, don’t copy code or text directly from an AI tool and please make a note of any tool you consulted at the top of your assignment.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two in-class closed book examinations. The mid-term examination will be held during normal class time in our normal classroom; the timing of this midterm will be designed to assess your mastery of the core concepts in social networks. The final will be held during the final exam period (see the date/time above). The final exam will be cumulative.\n\n\nParticipation and quizzes\nI will sometimes use iClicker to ask interactive questions during lectures. The correctness of responses to these questions will not matter - but they will be used as evidence of attendance. In some lectures, you may also be asked to participate in discussions and interactive demonstrations. Finally, there will also be a small number (about 2) quizzes on bCourses over the semester. These quizzes will consist of a few multiple choice questions; the goal of these quizzes will be to ensure that you are staying up to date with the reading and lecture materials covered in the class (including guest lectures). I will announce the timing of these quizzes in advance."

Reasonable common sense, judgment and the pursuit of mutual goodwill should result in the positive resolution of scheduling conflicts. The regular campus appeals process applies if a mutually satisfactory arrangement cannot be achieved.\nStatement on Academic Freedom\nBoth students and instructors have rights to academic freedom. Please respect the rights of others to express their points of view in the classroom.\nDSP Accommodations\nThe purpose of academic accommodations is to ensure that all students have a fair chance at academic success. Disability, or hardships such as basic needs insecurity, uncertain documentation and immigration status, medical and mental health concerns, pregnancy and parenting, significant familial distress, and experiencing sexual violence or harassment, can affect a student’s ability to satisfy particular course requirements. Students have the right to reasonable academic accommodations, without having to disclose personal information to instructors. For more information about accommodations, scheduling conflicts related to religious creed or extracurricular activities, please see the Academic Accommodations hub website.\nStudent Resources\nThe Student Learning Center provides a wide range of resources to promote learning and academic success for students. For information regarding these services, please consult the Student Learning Center Website: https://slc.berkeley.edu/\nClassroom Climate\nWe are all responsible for creating a learning environment that is welcoming, inclusive, equitable, and respectful. If you feel that these expectations are not being met, you can consult your instructor(s) or seek assistance from campus resources (see the Academic Accommodations website).\nAI\nYour work is expected to reflect your own ideas and should be prepared mostly without reliance on generative AI. Appropriate uses include translation, limited editing, early brainstorming, and formatting. Copying and pasting from an LLM into an assignment is not allowed, even if the results are then edited. If you are unsure if something is appropriate, ask. A good rule of thumb is to consider whether you would feel confident disclosing your process to your GSI or to me. Using AI extensively will be considered plagiarism and reported to Student Conduct.\nAcademic Integrity\nThe high academic standard at the University of California, Berkeley, is reflected in each degree that is awarded. As a result, every student is expected to maintain this high standard by ensuring that all academic work reflects unique ideas or properly attributes the ideas to the original sources.\nThese are some basic expectations of students with regards to academic integrity:\n\nAny work submitted should be your own individual thoughts, and should not have been submitted for credit in another course unless you have prior written permission to re-use it in this course from this instructor.\nAll assignments must use “proper attribution,” meaning that you have identified the original source and extent or words or ideas that you reproduce or use in your assignment. This includes drafts and homework assignments!\nIn general, you should not turn in work that was done by an AI tool, such as an LLM (like ChatGPT). If you have any questions, please ask an instructor.\nIf you are unclear about expectations, ask your instructor or GSI.\nDo not collaborate or work with other students on assignments or projects unless you have been given permission or instruction to do so."
