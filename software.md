The R package <a href="http://dfeehan.github.io/networkreporting/">networkreporting</a> 
implements the methods I develop in my dissertation, and also several
related techniques. 
<p>You can download the package from CRAN by typing
<p>
<code>
    install.packages("networkreporting")
</code>
</p>

<a href="https://github.com/dfeehan/networkreporting">github respository</a>.</td>
