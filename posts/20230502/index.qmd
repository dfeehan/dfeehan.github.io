I had a great time at PAA 2023 in New Orleans. I gave a talk on
an in-progress project on 
[estimating adult death rates from different social relationships](https://events.rdmobile.com/Asset/Download/11625956)
as part of Session 187 (Methodological Innovations in Mortality).
I also co-organized [Session 156 (Network Methods)](https://events.rdmobile.com/Sessions/Details/1725571).
