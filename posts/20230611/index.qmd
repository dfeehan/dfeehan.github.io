Just finished the week-long [Annual Workshop on Formal Demography](https://populationsciences.berkeley.edu/population-center/annual-workshop-on-formal-demography/), which I co-organized with Josh Goldstein and Michelle Poulin.
The focus this year was fertility. Since I usually work on mortality,
I had learned a lot. I also had a great time, and think/hope the
participants did, too. 

I'm already looking forward to next year! If you are
an early career scholar (grad student/postdoc/junior faculty) interested in
formal demography, please look out for the application call next spring.
