We have a [new paper just published  in *Epidemics*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436523000221?via%3Dihub).
This study combines BICS contact survey data with a disease model
to understand the implications of different vaccine prioritization strategies.
Congrats to Ethan Roubenoff, who was lead author - this is the first chapter of
his dissertation.
