I had a great visit to Boston, where I gave a talk as part of the [Harvard Social Demography Seminar](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population-development/event/social-demography-seminar-with-dennis-feehan/).
My talk focused on validating survey-based methods for estimating adult mortality,
using data collected in Brazil. Thanks to everyone at the talk for great questions
and a very enjoyable visit!
