This fall, I'm starting a new role as Faculty Director of Berkeley's
[D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/home). D-Lab is an amazing organization
focused on data science education, consulting, and research with a special
emphasis on diversity and inclusion. I'm tremendously excited to begin working
with the amazing group of scholars and data scientists at D-Lab this fall.
